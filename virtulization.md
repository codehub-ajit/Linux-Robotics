# Linux Virtualization Assignment

## Part 1: Virtualization Concepts
### Summary

#### Virtualization
- The process of creating a virtual version of something, such as hardware, storage, or network resources.

#### Hypervisor
- Software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). Examples include KVM, VMware, and Hyper-V.

#### Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Emulations of physical computers that run their own operating systems.

#### Containers
- Lightweight, isolated environments that share the host OS kernel but have their own file systems and libraries.

### **VMs vs Containers**
- The difference between VMs and Containers in terms of Architecture, Resource Utilization and Isolation

| **Aspect**    | **VMs**                                          | **Containers**    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Architecture**     | Requires a full OS for each instance            | Shares the host OS kernel      |
| **Resource Utilization** | Requires more resources                        | More lightweight and efficient   |
| **Isolation**        | Provides strong isolation since each VM has its own OS | Provides a lower level of isolation, as it shares the host OS kernel |

 

## Part 2: Multipass
### Installation
```bash
sudo snap install multipass
```
- Screenshot of Multipass installation.

- I practice the basic command 
1. Launch a default Ubuntu instance
```bash
multipass launch --name ajit-vm
```
- Screenshot of launching a default Ubuntu instance.

2. List all running instances
```bash 
multipass list
```
- Screenshot of listing running instances.

3. View details about an instance 
```bash
multipass info ajit-vm
```
- Screenshot of viewing details about an instance.

4. Access the shell of a running instance
```bash
multipass shell ajit-vm
```
- Screenshot of accessing the shell of a running instance.

5. Stop, delete and purge an instance
```bash
multipass stop ajit-vm
multipass delete ajit-vm
multipass purge
```
- Screenshot of stopping, deleting and purging an instance.

### Learn About Cloud-Init

1. Create a cloud-init.yaml file to customize an instance.
```bash
nano cloud-init.yaml
```
- Screenshot of creating a cloud-init.yaml file.
![Create a cloud-init.yaml file](image/nano%20cloud-init.png)
2. Launch an instance with cloud-init
```bash
multipass launch --name ajit-vm --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml
```
- Screenshot of launching an instance with cloud-init.
![Launch an instance with cloud-init](image/cloud%20lunch.png)

3.  Create a new folder and Mount the folder inside a VM:
```bash
mkdir ~/multipass_shared
multipass mount ~/multipass_shared ajit-vm:/mnt/shared
```
- Screenshot of mounting a folder inside a VM.
![Mount a folder inside a VM](image/mkdir%20and%20mount.png)

- I create a txt file inside multipass folder to share it in VM because without creating a file I can't mount the folder.
```bash 
echo "Hello, World!" > ~/multipass_shared/testfile.txt
```
- Screenshot of creating a txt file inside multipass folder.

4. Check the mounted folder inside the VM:
```bash
multipass shell ajit-vm
ls /mnt/shared
```
- Screenshot of mounting a folder inside a VM.

## Part 5: Snaps for Self-Contained Applications
1. What are snaps?
- Snaps are containerized software packages that include all the dependencies required to run an application. They are designed to work across different Linux distributions.
2. What is Snapcraft?
- Snapcraft is the command-line tool used to create and publish Snaps.

### Install Snapcraft
```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```
### Verify Snapcraft installation

    snapcraft --version

![Version](image/snapcraft%20version.png)

### Create a directory for Snap project
    mkdir hello-snap
    cd hello-snap
- Create a simple Python script named hello.py
    echo 'print("Hello, Snap!")' > hello.py

###  Create a Snapcraft Configuration File
- Initialize snapcraft
```bash
snapcraft init
```
- Edit the snapcraft.yaml file
```bash
nano snapcraft.yaml
```

![image inside nano](image/nano%20.png)

### Build the Snap
    snapcraft

### Install the Snap
    sudo snap install hello-snap_1.0_amd64.snap --dangerous
### Run the Snap   
    hello-snap.hello
